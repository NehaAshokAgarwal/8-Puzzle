# 8-Puzzle
Developed a board game using A* algorithm, Hamming and Manhattan distance, and priority queue to solve puzzles of N * N size.  
This project is related to my Algorithms and Data Strutures course at UMB. 
This project contains additional exerices : CertifyHeap.java, Ramanajuna1.java, and Ramanujan2.java. 
While the solver.java and Board.java are built to accomplish the gia of the project. 
The report is also attached which in detial explains what this two java programs does. 
This project is adapted from the Princeton Creative assignment website.
